# Differentiable Lensing Higher Order Statistics
Project to study higher order weak lensing statistics using differentiable simulations.

Project leads: [@dlanzieri](https://github.com/dlanzieri) (PhD project), [@EiffL](https://github.com/EiffL), [@modichirag](https://github.com/modichirag)

DESC members are most welcome to join the project, and can find more information on [this confluence page](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/Forecasting+the+power+of+Higher+Order+Weak+Lensing+Statistics+with+automatically+differentiable+simulations).

The simulation code will be based on the open source [FlowPM](https://github.com/modichirag/flowpm).
